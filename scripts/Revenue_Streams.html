			CodexArma needs to be implemented at an administrative level. So, it will be presented
			to the government as a service that is provided and maintained by us on a contractual basis. This
			will be our <b>primary revenue stream</b>.

			CodexArma also creates a framework that allows firearms manufacturers to scrutinize the
			demographics to whom their products are sold and how much of each product is sold, thus
			allowing them access to valuable market data from reliable sources. Manufacturers who wish to
			obtain this data will be charged for it. This will be the <b>secondary revenue stream</b>. (Note: this is
			an additional feature that manufacturers may opt to avail. They do not pay for providing data to
			the blockchain.)
			Another potential source of revenue could be insurance companies that wish to use the
			blockchain for data collection on gun owners.
